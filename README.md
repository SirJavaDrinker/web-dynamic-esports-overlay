# Dynamic Esports Overlay üñ•Ô∏è
This project is a simple web-based overlay that can be edited using the "admin" panel, built using Node.js. 

Allows real-time editing of match data such as score, map list, team names, and colors, which are stored in a local `data.json` file.

## Usage
### Ensure NodeJS is installed locally.
Run `node -v` within a terminal to check if you have it installed / what version you have.
- visit https://nodejs.org/en/download for more instructions and info on NodeJS
### Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/SirJavaDrinker/web-dynamic-esports-overlay.git```
### Navigate to the project directory.
Once inside the correct directory, simply run `node index.js` to start up the server.

By default this will open up a locally hosted server at port: `9999`

Navigate to:
- http://localhost:9999/ 		to view the overlay.
- http://localhost:9999/admin 	to view and access the overlay settings panel.
