## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è
### Ensure NodeJS is installed locally.
Run `node -v` within a terminal to check if you have it installed / what version you have.
- visit https://nodejs.org/en/download for more instructions and info on NodeJS
### Setup (Terminal)
Run: ```git clone https://github.com/SirJavaDrinker/web-dynamic-esports-overlay.git``` to clone the repository.

Once inside the correct directory, simply run `node index.js` to start up the server.

By default this will open up a locally hosted server at port: `9999`

Navigate to:
- http://localhost:9999/ 		to view the overlay.
- http://localhost:9999/admin 	to view and access the overlay settings panel.

## OBS Setup ‚è∫Ô∏è
In the sources tab, add a new browser source, then add in the overlay URL in the URL bar... and done! As long as the server is running in a terminal, it should work!
